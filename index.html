<h4 class="text-center">Who am I?</h4>

<p style="text-align:justify">
  My name is Angel Perez, a Venezuela-based Information Engineer, Backend
  Developer and a Polyglot, as well as an (almost) self-trained, <em>not-so-amateur</em>
  photographer and a frustrated Sound Engineer.
</p>

<h4 class="text-center">What I do</h4>

<p style="text-align:justify">
  I'm currently making a living developing <em>state-of-the-art</em> Ruby
  applications and getting my hands dirty with JavaScript, Rust and Scala in
  order to become some sort of polyglot Backend tailor.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">
  Besides programming, I'm also deeply interested in areas such as art, history,
  languages, literature, music (I consider myself a <em>music-driven</em> human being)
  and philosophy.
</p>

<h4 class="text-center">Interested?</h4>
